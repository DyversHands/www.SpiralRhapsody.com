 bio: "the intervals change\n the notes braid into a fugue\n a major charges forward\n a minor follows, descending into a conclusion\n the up-and-down turns left\n i forget to breathe\n and iâ€™m dizzy with a kind of living.\n i am a thread of things\n spun loose and coiling back on themselves.\n a spiral rhapsody.\n       -- Christopher Allen"
