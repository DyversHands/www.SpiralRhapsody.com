 bio: |
   "the intervals change.
   the notes braid into a fugue.
   a major charges forward.
   a minor follows,
   descending toward a conclusion
   the up-and-down turns left
   and i forget to breathe.
   iâ€™m dizzy with a kind of living.
   i am a thread of things spun loose and coiling back on themselves.
   in a spiral rhapsody. " -- Christopher Allen
